        <h3>Bermuda-Triangle</h3>
        <p>
          Tales of lost mariners and disappeared ships, crashed aircraft and
          even vanishing humans, have been emerging from the waters of the
          Bermuda Triangle for centuries. The vast area of more than half a
          million square miles is also known as the Devil’s Triangle, and
          theories as to why so many travelers fall foul of its clutches abound.
          Some say there are magnetic anomalies that throw compasses off course,
          others that tropical cyclones are to blame, and some say there’s
          simply no mystery at all! Today, visiting the area can be much more
          pleasant than you might think, with the sun-splashed islands of Turks
          and Caicos beckoning in the south and the coves of Bermuda in the
          north. You may actually want to never be seen again!

        <h3>The Banff Springs Hotel, Canada</h3>
        <p>
          With overtures of the Timberline Lodge of Stephen King and Stanley
          Kubrick’s The Shining fame, the Banff Springs Hotel of Canada is said
          to be the home of a plethora of ghost stories and mysterious
          happenings. Locals tell tales of an entire family that was murdered in
          cold-blood in room 873. Others talk of reappearing doormen who vanish
          into thin air. But if you think you can deal with the supernatural
          rep, then you’re in for a real treat here. The handsome hotel oozes
          Scottish Baronial styles, is shrouded by the fir-dressed peaks of the
          Canadian Rockies, and offers access to the iconic ski fields of Jasper
          and Banff. Worth the risk? We think so!

        <h3>Transylvania, Romania</h3>
        <p>
          Sylvan hills and mist-topped mountains, the clanging echo of church
          bells and the stone-built medieval steeples of towns like Sibiu,
          Brasov and Cluj, all add to the eerie atmosphere of this vast region
          at the very heart of Romania. But it’s one place that really brings
          the chills and gets the spine a-tingling: Bran Castle. This
          turret-topped citadel soars from the forests on the edge of Wallachia
          in a medley of Gothic towers and gargoyle-peppered roofs. Over the
          years it’s been associated with a number of less-than-savoury,
          uber-mysterious figures: Vlad the Impaler, the most bloodthirsty of
          the Wallachian kings, and – of course – Count Dracula, the archetype
          of the nail-biting Nosferatu.

        <h3>Crooked Forest, Poland</h3>
        <p>
          Just south of the unpronounceable city of Szczecin on Poland’s extreme
          eastern haunch, a stone’s throw west of the border with Germany, a
          small clutch of just over 400 pine trees has been garnering the
          attention of Atlas Obscura types and off-the-beaten-track travelers
          for years. The entire forest appears to be bent over almost 90 degrees
          at the trunk, before twisting back straight again and growing
          vertically into the Slavic sky. Debate has raged as to what caused the
          unusual wood to come to look like it has, with theories as wide
          ranging as torrential snowstorms and lumberjack growing techniques

        <h3>Bhangarh Fort, India</h3>
        <p>
          Enfolded by the rises of the Aravali Hills and baked by the Rajasthani
          sun, the old bulwarks of the Bhangarh Fort are said to echo with the
          ethereal presence of one cursed princess and her would-be captor, the
          wizard Sinhai. It’s said that Sinhai tried to ensnare the young royal
          by offering her a love potion. The plan backfired, the wizard ended up
          dead, but not before he could lay his hex on all the inhabitants of
          Bhangarh. Today, the Mughlai complex once trodden by Madho Singh I is
          considered one of the most haunted spots in India. No one is allowed
          to enter after dark, and locals have even reported deaths as a result
          of the continued curse

        <h3>The Skirrid Mountain Inn, Wales</h3>
        <p>
          Set between the rising fells and lichen-spotted stone villages on the
          eastern edge of the beautiful Brecon Beacons National Park (Wales’
          lesser-known, southern mountain range), The Skirrid Mountain Inn oozes
          with tales and stories of the Gaelic nation’s past. Some say it was
          the gathering point of rebel fighters under the banner of Owain
          Glyndŵr, the hero of Welsh resistance against Henry IV. Others claim
          that it was once a courthouse where criminals were not only condemned
          to death but also hung, all under the command of the infamous
          so-called Hanging Judge, George Jeffreys. There’s even a swinging
          noose still dangling from the rafters inside, and oodles of ghost
          stories to hear over your cawl (traditional Welsh soup)!
